# AirAware
AirAware: The Vital shield against toxic air epidemic, forging lethal data into policybacked survival act 🛡️💨

AirAware is a decision engine designed to combat the "silent airborne epidemic." Moving beyond passive dashboards, AirAware leverages Google Cloud and Predictive AI to turn abstract AQI numbers into personalized, visceral health mandates.


🚀 The Problem
Existing air quality tools are passive. They provide data without direction, leaving a lethal gap between knowing the air is toxic and knowing how to survive it. In many cities, breathing has become a silent risk, causing cumulative, irreversible lung damage that often goes untracked until it's too late.


✨ Key Features
🫁 The Lungs Diary: Translates invisible toxins into a "Cigarette-Equivalent" count, making the health impact of pollution tangible.

⏳ Estimated Lung Age: A visceral metric that estimates your biological lung age based on cumulative exposure and sensitivity profiles. (Note: Awareness-focused, not a medical diagnosis).

🔮 Predictive Safety Windows: Uses TensorFlow and the Google Air Quality API to forecast "Toxic Peaks" 48 hours in advance, allowing for proactive schedule adjustments.

🎮 Lung-Saving Legends: A gamified experience that rewards users with points and leaderboard rankings for choosing cleaner routes and practicing mask compliance.

🤖 Sympathetic Nudges: Gemini-powered notifications that provide empathetic, human-readable guidance instead of cold technical alerts.
